# Project work
## LKM Creations
### Portfolio Project Five

This is my website for LKM Creations.
The goal of this site was to build a Full-Stack E-Commerce site.

Building a Full-Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. Set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.

The site takes advantage of the Django Framework and Bootstrap.
