## Leanne's Learners

### Portfolio Project Four

This is my website for Leanne's Learners.
The goal of this site was to build a Full-Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. Setting up an authentication mechanism and providing a role-based access to the site's data or other activities based on the dataset.  
The Site allows Staff members to create, edit and delete blog posts from the Frontend. Also be able to delete any Post's comment.  
Registered site users can add likes to posts, create comments, add likes and dislikes to comments, reply to comments and delete their own comments.
Staff members are able to fill all pages information from within the Administration site.

The site takes advantage of the Django Framework and Bootstrap.

This is my Hangman game.
The goal of the game is to demonstrate my knowledge of python whilst providing a fun game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku with the constraints of a window size of 80 by 24 characters . The Game words are fetched from [Random Word (API)](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home)
